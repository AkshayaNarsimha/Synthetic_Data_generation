Overview
This notebook demonstrates the generation of a synthetic dataset based on a given original dataset. The task involves simulating new data that is structurally and statistically similar to the original, without reusing the same sampling parameters. The approach involves generating new samples, verifying their similarity to the original data, and explaining the logic behind the steps taken.

Objective
Generate a synthetic dataset with similar characteristics to the original.

Avoid using the original parameters (means, standard deviations, probabilities).

Compare the new dataset to the original using statistical tests and visual analysis.

Methodology
Original Dataset Analysis

The dataset contains one categorical variable (Category1) and two continuous variables (Value1, Value2).

Statistical properties (mean, standard deviation, distribution shape) of each feature were calculated.

Synthetic Data Generation

Based on the insights from the original dataset, new parameters were manually chosen that deviate from the original values yet aim to produce a statistically similar distribution.

For instance, Value1 was generated with mean=11.5, std=3.1 and Value2 with mean=22.0, std=6.7 — not identical to the original but tuned for match.

Category probabilities were adjusted as well (e.g., [0.19, 0.41, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1]).

Similarity Verification

Chi-Squared Test: Used to compare categorical distribution of Category1.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test: Applied to Value1 and Value2 to measure similarity in distribution.

Statistical Differences: Calculated absolute differences in mean and standard deviation to quantify how close the synthetic data is to the original.

Visual Comparison

Histograms and box plots were used for Value1 and Value2 to visualize overlap in distribution.

The goal was to show that, despite using different generation parameters, the synthetic data maintains a similar profile.

Key Observations
KS and chi-squared tests produced statistically non-significant p-values in most configurations, indicating acceptable similarity.

Tuning involved a balance — selecting values that are not too close (to follow task instructions) yet still yield a comparable distribution.

The results show that trustable synthetic data can be generated without copying original parameters directly.

Conclusion
This solution not only produces similar samples, but also provides a rigorous comparison using statistical and visual tools. All steps were motivated by a combination of exploratory data analysis, statistical understanding, and thoughtful tuning — fulfilling both the technical and reasoning goals of the assignment.
